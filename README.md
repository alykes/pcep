Best practise is to always use single quotes and escape characters if need be.  

can't start variables with a number  

can't use these variable names  
from  
global  

program is set of instructions executed by a computer  
instruction list is a set of instructions the given computer can execute  

Translation processes source code to machine code

*compilation* - compile once and anyone can execute  
*interpretation* - interpret source code every time you run programs, everyone need the interpreter to run  

top to bottom execution of the code  
throws errors based on the following:  
- lexis - using keywords as variables  
- syntax - forgetting brackets  
- semantics- multiple arguments for a command that doesn't accept them  

Always use 4 spaces for the indentation as a best practise
